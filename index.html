            <br><br>
            My name is Ediubong Aniekan Ekwere. Edi for short. I was born and raised in Houston, Texas. From an early age, I was always enamoured with fantasy storytelling and the many ways to deliver said stories. I grew up reading books like Harry Potter and Warriors(Cats). These series got me invested in long-form storytelling and deep interesting characters. I was also introduced to Anime and Video Games at a young ages which pushed my imagination to new heights. I began learning about the many ways to deliver a story, and became  I would create short stories in the form of comics, or in the form of a series of illustrations. Fantasy storytelling became one of my main hobbies and eventually I realized I wanted to create my own fantasy world for people to digest the same way I did with theirs.
            <br><br>
            Overtime, I began exploring different mediums more in-depth. On top of art, I also got used to using and navigating computers. Once I had finally got the hang of computers, I began learning how to code. Early on, I took the route of self-teaching HTML, CSS and Ruby. With the help of some friends and some online resources, I used Ruby to create fan game named 'Pokémon Floral Tempus'. While working on this fan game, I became accustomed to the mindset and workflow of a game developer. I realized that I thoroughly enjoyed being able to create things, and I wanted to take my skills to the next level. This is when I took my abilities to C++, and then later C# and Unity.
            <br><br>
            While working on this fan-game I was attending classes at the Houston Community College (HCC) with the intent of gaining more knowledge on different coding languages. Through HCC courses, I learned computer organization skills and object oriented programming in C#. During this time, i was also balancing jobs at Dominoes as delivery driver, then GameStop as a Game Advisor, and later worked as an accountant at Azico Financial Services. I was solely focused on absorbing as much knowledge as I could to ready myself for the day when I could put all of these skills to use to create my dream franchise. After working and learning for about 2-3 years. I still felt that I wasn't satisfied with my current level of coding knowledge. In the summer of 2023, I enrolled in a Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp. Through this bootcamp, I was able to brush up on my knowledge of HTML and CSS, while also learning Javascript (js), MySQL, NoSQL, graphQL, NodeJs, and ReactJs. By the end of the bootcamp, I was a full fledged Full-Stack Web Developer and now had two more games under my belt that I had created.
            <br><br>
            Some might say that I'm stretching myself thin, by trying to become competent at so many different professions, however I only see this as a challenge to become the best person I know I can be. I have a dream to one day create a franchise that I can tell through many different mediums. I want to write books, write comics, draw illustrations, code games and maybe even write movies. I know that all of this is achievable, thats why I push myself to learn at every step of the way. I believe that all people can learn anything they set their mind to with healthy pacing and patience. Failures are a normal part of the human experience, and it's only through failing can we really become our best selves. I'm willing to fail as many times as it takes, as long as I can see my dream come true.
